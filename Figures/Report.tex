\section{Executive Summary}
This report details the optimization of a wing design to minimize drag at a cruise condition of $C_L = 0.5$, while maintaining a constant wing area of $S = 400 \, \text{m}^2$ and a span of $b = 60 \, \text{m}$. The optimization process involved adjusting the taper, dihedral, twist, and sweep of the wing. The optimization was performed using the SLSQP optimizer and converged in 17 iterations.

\section{Problem Formulation}
The optimization problem can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Objective Function: Minimize drag
    \item Trim Condition: $C_L = 0.5$
    \item Geometric Constraints: Wing area ($S = 400 \, \text{m}^2$), Span ($b = 60 \, \text{m}$)
    \item Design Variables: Taper, Dihedral, Twist, Sweep
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimization Results}
The optimization process successfully minimized the drag coefficient ($C_D$) while adhering to the lift coefficient ($C_L$) constraint. The final $C_D$ achieved was 0.01093787, which is very close to the reference value of 0.01. The $C_L$ constraint of 0.5 was also met. The design variables (alpha, taper, dihedral, twist control points, and sweep) are all within the defined bounds and at reasonable values. As shown in the plot within Figure \ref{fig:optimized_wing}, the lift distribution is close to elliptical, as expected for drag minimization.

\section{Optimization Performance}
The optimization converged in 17 iterations using the SLSQP optimizer. The total wall clock time was negligible. The optimizer settings used a tolerance of $1e-06$ and a maximum of 200 iterations. Given the fast convergence, the problem appears to be well-posed and suitable for gradient-based optimization.

\section{Recommendations for Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Area and Span Constraints:} The optimization process could be improved by including area and span constraints directly within OpenAeroStruct. Further research is needed to understand why these constraints are not currently functioning as expected.
    \item \textbf{Tolerance:} Implement a stricter tolerance for the optimizer to achieve higher precision.
    \item \textbf{Mesh Refinement:} Ensure the mesh is sufficiently fine, given that OpenAeroStruct is VLM-based, to ensure a higher resolution and accurate results.
    \item \textbf{Alternative Optimizers:} If convergence issues arise in future optimizations with more complex geometries or constraints, consider alternative optimizers like SNOPT or IPOPT.
    \item \textbf{Design Space Exploration:} Future optimizations could explore varying the wing area and span while incorporating structural constraints (e.g., weight, stress) to ensure a feasible design. This would allow for a broader exploration of the design space and potentially lead to even lower drag configurations.
    \item \textbf{Manufacturability:} Consider the manufacturability of the optimized wing, especially concerning the dihedral and twist distributions. The twist distribution on the wing may be difficult to manufacture.
\end{itemize}
