       "{'Analysis': \"The optimization aimed to minimize drag (CD) at a lift coefficient (CL) of 2.0, while maintaining a wing area of 100 m^2 and a span of 10 m. The design variables were taper, twist, and sweep. The optimization used the SLSQP algorithm. The optimization failed to converge. The final drag coefficient is 0.11836269. The lift distribution is close to elliptical. The taper ratio is at it's lower bound, and the sweep is at it's lower bound. Looking at the twist, one control point is at the lower bound, and one is not. Alpha is not at the bound. It seems like the optimization is trying to reduce the area at the tip as much as possible by reducing the taper ratio.\",\n",
       " 'Recommendations': 'Since the optimization failed to converge, I would recommend looking into convergence issues. I would first try running with more iterations. Then, I would look into scaling the objective functions and constraints. I would also recommend trying a different optimization algorithm such as the interior point optimizer. From the looks of it, it may be beneficial to add the quarter chord location as a design variable as well.',\n",
       " 'Optimization Performance': 'The optimization was not successful, failing to converge within 60 iterations, although the optimizer was set for 200 iterations. The wall clock time was only 1 second. The SLSQP optimizer was used. I suggest trying an interior point optimizer such as IPOPT or SNOPT.',\n",
       " 'Unrelated Observations': 'The problem is formulated with an unusually high lift coefficient of 2.0. This is probably outside of the linear region. I also observe that the plots do not seem to be normalized which makes it harder to read.'}"
