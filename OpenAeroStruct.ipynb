The design variables were taper, twist, and sweep. The optimization process exited with a FAIL status. The final drag coefficient (CD) achieved was 0.1184. The lift distribution is very close to the elliptical lift distribution. The optimization failed to converge. The twist distribution is constant, this is not typical.',\n",
       " 'Recommendations': \"Given the optimization's failure to converge, several strategies should be considered. First, examine the initial design space to ensure that the bounds are not overly restrictive and that a feasible solution exists within the defined constraints. Since SLSQP struggled, try a different optimization algorithm such as a genetic algorithm. It's also worth noting the optimization was terminated prematurely, with a max iteration number of 200. Increase this to improve convergence, or reduce it to reduce simulation time if the optimization is clearly going to fail. Given the non-physical twist distribution, it is recommended that this be constrained.\",\n",
       " 'Optimization Performance': 'The optimization was performed using the SLSQP algorithm and ran for 183 iterations. The wall clock run time was approximately 3 seconds. The optimization exited with a \"FAIL\" status, indicating it did not converge successfully. This suggests that the SLSQP algorithm may not be well-suited for this particular problem, potentially due to the nature of the objective function or constraints.',\n",
       " 'Unrelated Observations': \"The constant twist distribution is uncharacteristic of an optimized wing. This could imply constraints within the optimization setup that limited the twist's variability, issues with the solver's ability to explore the design space, or even characteristics of the VLM that result in non-physical values.\"}"
