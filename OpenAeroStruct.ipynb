Some optimizers might be more effective at navigating the design space and finding global minima compared to the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) method used in this optimization.\n",

OpenAeroStruct utilizes a vortex lattice method, which is an approximation. CFD simulations will provide a more accurate assessment of the wing's aerodynamic performance. Doing so will ensure the results seen here are valid.\n",
