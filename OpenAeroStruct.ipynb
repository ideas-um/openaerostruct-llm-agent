Adjust optimization parameters: Experiment with different values for tolerance (`tol`) and maximum iterations (`maxiter`) to promote convergence.

Ensure these bounds are physically reasonable and do not overly restrict the design space.\\n4.  Check the gradients and sensitivities: Make sure the sensitivities are well calculated. If not, then the optimization will likely fail.\\n5.  Increase mesh fidelity: A denser mesh can provide more accurate aerodynamic results, potentially leading to a better-optimized design.
