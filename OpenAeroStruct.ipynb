The design variables converged to specific values: wing taper is 0.2 which is the lower limit, sweep is 28.5 which is the upper limit, and twist ranges from 1.46 to 2.47. Also, the final lift distribution is close to an elliptical distribution.',\n",
       " 'Recommendations': '1.  Re-run the optimization with relaxed bounds. The taper ratio appears to have hit its lower bound during optimization. It may be beneficial to re-run the optimization with a lower bound of taper ratio even closer to 0, such as 0.05 or 0.1. The sweep also hit the upper bound, and one can consider relaxing the upper bound of sweep, for example to 40 or 45.\\n2.  Refine the mesh. Increase the number of elements to see if the elliptical lift distribution improves.\\n3.  Consider adding a constraint on the stall speed.',\n",
